## Preamble
Over the past couple of years I've accumulated bookmarks, saved Reddit posts, and GitHub stars all related to piracy in some form or another. This list is my attempt to add structure to those resources and share them. Everything you need to get started on your pirate voyage can be found below.

I am aware that a number of websites featured in this list rely on operating under obscurity, and that this list could potentially contribute to their demise through excess exposure. I'm sorry about that - I just like making lists.

Please ensure you use an adblocker like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to access any of the websites listed here, otherwise, you will have a bad time.

For discussion and feedback, please head to [the Reddit thread on /r/Piracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/9nontk/awesome_piracy_a_curated_list_of_awesome_warez/). If you come across dead links, please report them by [creating an issue](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy/issues/new).

## Mirrors
This list is periodically mirrored to [PasteBin](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy/blob/master/pastebin.url).

## How to use this list
Some items in this list could easily fit in more than one category, so to make sure you find what you're looking for please use `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on macOS).

## Emoji
You will notice some items in this list have a :star2: next to them. Items with a :star2: represent the author's top pick for that category. This is an entirely opinionated rating from someone who doesn't know everything about every item on the list, so be sure to check out alternative options before assuming something is "the best". That said, I do explore and test every resource I add to this list wherever possible.
